campus navigation system based on the A* algorithm which is used to find the shortest path from the source to reach the destination.
here we use 2 sources
1) where we start from
2) where we have to reach the destination
from source to destination there are many ways to reach the destination we find the shortest path to reach the destination
for the GUI we used streamlit
for finding the shortest path we use priority queue
we have to select source and destination then we seen a path in a graphical representation
